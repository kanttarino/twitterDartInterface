twitterDartInterface
====================

This is a simple application to test <b>Dart</b>. Done within about three hours to test the language.


<ul>
  <li>Type an username and a message and it will appear in the left column.</li>
  <li>You can use <b>@mentions</b> and <b>#hashtags</b> to see them colored.</li>
  <li>Basic usage of querySelector, keyboardEvent and DOM elements.</li>
</ul>

NOTE: This may be useful for people starting with the language. Do not look here for any advanced thing.

Anything you need about this, let me know.

Cheers
